# üê£ Getting Started

Prerequisites:

* A legit, clean copy of GTA V on PC
* [FiveM](https://fivem.net/) installed and linked to [Discord](https://discord.com/)
* Some common sense

Access to the RP server starts with joining the [Discord community](https://t.co/VSUpleuwNP), reading and accepting the rules and being an overall good sport.

Once in discord, you will have the chance to get a feel for the people you will potentially be playing with, before you submit an application form found in the [**#how-to-play**](https://discord.com/channels/837673530963394570/848932024735236157) channel.\
Applications are read and considered within 24-48 hours in most cases.

Alternatively, if you feel uncomfortable filling out a written application there is also the option of doing a voice application with one of our team members.
