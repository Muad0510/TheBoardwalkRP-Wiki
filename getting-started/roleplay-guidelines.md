Roleplay Safe Word: BANGARANG.

This is used whenever somebody feels uncomfortable with any RP going on at that time, the roleplay stops and admins are to be informed immediately. We do not tolerate players purposefully trying to make others uncomfortable with extreme conversation topic or acts.

On that note, the safe word should only be used in these cases, if admins find you are using this word not for its intended purpose you will be removed from the community.
